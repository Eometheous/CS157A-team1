# Flight Seat Reservation System
Jonathan Thomas, Taehun Lee, Akshit Sharma
## Project Description
This project is an extension of a simple flight reservation program made in Java that previously used a file system and ran on the command line. This updated version will run on a web browser and utilize databases using a MySQL server. The reason for making this program is to see how the implementation changes from a file system implementation run on one computer to a three-tier architecture system using a web browser, web server, and MySQL database. 

Flights will have three classes: First class, Economy Plus, and Economy. Users of this application will be able to sign up with an email and password and username, log in to their account, search and view flights and their available seats, select seats to reserve, purchase seats for a flight, view their purchased seats, and cancel reservations. 

Admins will be able to view the manifest list for flights and see purchased seats and who purchased them. Add new flights, cancel flights, and edit flight information. 

The application will have an easy-to-use interface, unlike the original program which ran via the command line as a console Java application.
